Predictions for cheese example:

1) Alpha will change store to store, beta might change, will depend on the display
2) 88 different stores, need to handle each one
3) We expect modest difference in the PED (beta) from regional differences.
4) We suspect the influence of displays will not affect consumer behavior store-to-store.
	In other words, we anticipate that display is a 'fixed effect', in the sense used by statisticians.
5) We suspect there will be evidence for mis-fit.
